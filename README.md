🚗 5K Hydrogen Pursuit – Edmonton Global Simulation Game

Harjoban Singh (Machine Learning Analyst)

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the 5K Hydrogen Vehicle Pursuit, a game-based initiative developed in partnership with Edmonton Global to promote awareness of hydrogen-powered transportation. The game is built using Python and Pygame, incorporating real-time interactivity, vehicle management, and refueling logic. Designed for use in public exhibitions, the game was showcased in preparation for the Canadian Hydrogen Convention 2025 and demonstrates how serious gaming can drive engagement and education.

Players must strategically collect hydrogen fuel, avoid road obstacles, and deploy a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to reach the milestone of 5000 units within five minutes.

🎯 Game Objectives

Maintain fuel levels by collecting hydrogen fuel cells scattered across the map.

Unlock and deploy various hydrogen-powered vehicles, including bikes, cars, and trucks.

Establish refueling infrastructure by strategic movement and planning.

Avoid collisions with red obstacles that can instantly end the game.

Complete the mission of deploying 5000 vehicles before the timer runs out.

🕹 Gameplay Summary

Player Start: The game begins with one vehicle and 100 fuel units.
Fuel Collection: Players must gather fuel cells to continue operating and unlock additional vehicles.

Vehicle Types:

🏍 Bikes: Fast-moving, easy to collect, moderate score.

🚗 Cars: Balanced in speed and reward.

🚛 Trucks: Appear rarely but offer high scores.

Obstacles:


🔴 Barrier Cars

🔴 Red Blocks – Immediate game-ending collision.

Game Interface:

Countdown timer

Live fuel level bar

Deployed vehicle counter

End-screen summary with success/failure message

🧠 Key Features

The game uses an object-oriented design, where each player’s state (movement, fuel, unlocked vehicles) is encapsulated in a player class. It supports dynamic element spawning to enhance replayability, including randomized fuel cell and obstacle generation. The HUD (Heads-Up Display) provides live updates for key metrics, including fuel, time remaining, and vehicle count.

Game Loop:
